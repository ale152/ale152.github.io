title: "Some code I wrote"
---

All of my research involves coding, which is mostly in Python, Matlab and sometimes C++. Sometimes I publish my code online and here are some of the programs I wrote in the past years.

###   Research Associate (SPHERE)
* [CaloriNet](https://github.com/ale152/CaloriNet) <br/>
 A deep learning framework for the estimation of calories burnt in an indoor environment. This repository includes the Python implementation of the algorithm described in the BMVC paper _[CaloriNet: From silhouettes to calorie estimation in private environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08152)_
* [MUltiple VIdeos LABelling tool (MuViLab)](https://github.com/ale152/muvilab) <br/>
 MuViLab is an annotation tool for labelling videos. With MuViLab, you can split your long video into short clips of 3-4 seconds, which are shown simultaneously in loop on screen. With a single glance, you'll be able to identify and label short events in ~100 clips, speeding up your job by almost 100 times!
* [Silhouette-wearable matching](https://github.com/ale152/video-accelerometer-matching) <br/>
 This repository contains the Python implementation of the algorithm described in the paper _[Who Goes There? Exploiting Silhouettes and Wearable Signals for Subject Identification in Multi-Person Environments](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/CVPM/Masullo_Who_Goes_There_Exploiting_Silhouettes_and_Wearable_Signals_for_Subject_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf)_
 
###  PhD
* [Automated mask generation for PIV](https://github.com/ale152/automagic_mask) <br/>
 This algorithm is designed to help the analysis of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) images by automatically creating a mask based on the statistics of a set of images. Background regions are characterised by a Gaussian distribution of the pixels while particle images present a strongly skewed distribution. For more information check out _[Automated mask generation for PIV image analysis based on pixel intensity statistics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00348-017-2357-3)_
* [POD-based background removal for Particle Image Velocimetry](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59655-pod-based-background-removal-for-particle-image-velocimetry) <br/>
 This software includes the Matlab implementation of the algorithm described in the paper _[POD-based background removal for particle image velocimetry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894177716302266)_
 * [Matlab File Exchange](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3265833-alessandro-masullo?utf8=%E2%9C%93&detail2=&detail=fileexchange) <br/>
 During my PhD, I coded mostly in Matlab and I created several small scripts and functions that I collected on my _Matlab File Exchange_.
