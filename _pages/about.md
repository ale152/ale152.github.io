My name is Alessandro (or Ale) and I live in Bristol, UK. I'm originally from Naples, Italy, where I studied Aerospace Engineering at _Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II_. I moved to Bristol in 2014 for the final year project of my Master thesis and then got an offer for a [PhD](/research/#phd-research) position. I really love Bristol (great vibe, great food), so I decided to stay here after my PhD and started a [postdoc](/research/) in Computer Vision. After three years of postdoc, I found an open position for lecturer in Digital Health, so I applied for it and managed to get it.

I love understanding complicated things and solving problems, which is why I chose to study Aerospace Engineering (Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence are fascinating!). My passion for computers and technology drove me towards the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, which are currently my main interests.

I spend most of my free time climbing (indoor bouldering and outdoor sport). If you're interested, you can find my UKC profile [here](https://www.ukclimbing.com/user/profile.php?id=245319). Here is a picture I took from one of my favourite crags in Portland (UK, _yes, UK_), Wallsend South:

On rest days, I also spend some time playing the piano, cycling, taking pictures ([Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/laumosl/)) and learning how to use synthesizers. In addition to this website, I also have a [blog](http://www.wirgilio.it/blog/), where I used to talk about science, engineering and coding. It's written in Italian and I haven't updated it for several years now... If I write anything now, it'll probably be [here](/blog/) and in English.
