### About me
I'm currently working as a Research Associate at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), UK, for the [SPHERE project](https://www.irc-sphere.ac.uk/), where we apply Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms to sensor data for Digital Health.

My current research interests focus on Computer Vision, Human Motion Analysis, Sensor Fusion and Digital Health.
